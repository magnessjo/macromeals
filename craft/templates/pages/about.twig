          <h1>Macro Meals was founded in 2017 by Rebecca and Josh Magness. The concept was spawned from experiences with other vendors who didn't provide a worthwhile service. The concept was to simply provide convenient balanced meals that were fresh and tasted good.</h1>
          <p>Initially, the business wasn’t anything more than a typical ‘Sunday Prepday’ . We wanted to help out friends and family members who had health and fitness goals but not a lot of time or intricate knowledge. A business began to grow as interest increased.</p>
          <p>We’ve worked for over a year cultivating a menu that we loved, and continue to add to this menu. We work with local farms and vendors to bring you the best ingredients with no preservatives added. </p>
          <p>By collaborating with local businesses we are also able to provide a number of pickup locations. For those who are not local or just prefer delivery, we use UPS to provide overnight delivery options.</p>
          <p>In the Winter of 2017, Macro Meals opened it’s online store to the public. And the rest is history in the making.</p>

        <h1>Rebecca's Journey</h1>
        <h2>My path to happiness and health had a lot of bumps and detours, but I've found the keys to my success include: hard work, consistency, and smart choices from two decades in the pursuit of health.</h2>
        <p>I was an obese teenager who was unhappy. I smoked two packs a day and lived off of Ramen noodle and junk food.  I had no idea what a healthy diet consisted of and no idea how to be healthy. The slightest exertion would cause me to wheez and it was embarrassing.  I knew I had to make a change</p>
        <p>I wasn't sure where to start so I started going to the gym.  I was intimated at first, but I went everyday and embrace the grind.  Eventually, a phenomenal personal trainer noticed my effort and offered to train me in his spare time.  Before I knew it, the gym had become my happy place.  I loved running.  I loved weight training.  I loved the challenges and milestones.<p>
        <p>Gym life was for me, but something was still missing.  My body was breaking down quicker than the people that I was training with.  I thought I was eating 'healthy' since I was a vegetarian, but my diet at this point consisted of most vegetables and a little bit of fruit.  A friend recommend a book on nutrition and my inner mad scientist was born.  I loved to experiment with as many foods as possible.  My boyfriend (now husband) was the poor victim of many awful dishes, but a decade of trial (and error) helped me to develop the base that has became Macro Meals.</p>
        <p>When I turned thirty, I was a gym rat and a foodie.  I was healthy and happy but I felt like something was still missing.  I wanted to contribute in the same way that others had for me.  I became ACE certified and completed a nutrition specialist certification.  I taught a few Zumba classes and took every opportunity to help the people that I saw struggling like I once did.  At this time in my life I was working as a clinical research coordinator.  I loved my job and the people that I worked with but it felt like we were on cleanup duty.  We weren't making the difference that I dreamed of.  After a year a debating and with the encouragement of friends and family; I left the career that I loved and Macro Meals was born.  </p>

            <p>Love this service! I am an avid meal prepper, but when I am in a jam, I know where to go to order beautiful, balanced, tasty meals. Everything is fresh. Great texture combinations. Everything reheats really well - the meat stays tender and the veggies crisp (still do not know how they do it). The macro counts vary by meal and they come in a couple sizes, so I can pick the one that suits me for the day. Takes a lot of hassle out of eating well. The quality of ingredients is also appreciated! I know they will continue to work with local, small businesses for different ingredients as the seasons permit. Thanks for helping us all make healthy choices!</p>

            <p>Great healthy meals with great flavor! Perfect for people on the go. These meals are great for anyone looking to eat healthy and track their macros. The best part is they take all the hassle of making the meals out of my hands. Our favorites are the Momma's Turkey Meatloaf, BBQ Chicken and the Taco Tuesday TVP.</p>

            <p>Just got my first order. Loved the coconut squash curry and the Garam Masala lentils. My son really liked the taco Tuesday even though he's not vegetarian. I've been eating the packaged veggie meals from the grocery which have a tendency to taste like cardboard, so these tasty-and healthy- meals are a great change.</p>
