          <h1>Macro Meals was founded in 2017 by Rebecca and Josh Magness. The concept was spawned from experiences with other vendors who didn't provide a worthwhile service. The concept was to simply provide convenient balanced meals that were fresh and tasted good.</h1>
          <p>Initially, the business wasn’t anything more than a typical ‘Sunday Prepday’ . We wanted to help out friends and family members who had health and fitness goals but not a lot of time or intricate knowledge. A business began to grow as interest increased.</p>
          <p>We’ve worked for over a year cultivating a menu that we loved, and continue to add to this menu. We work with local farms and vendors to bring you the best ingredients with no preservatives added. </p>
          <p>By collaborating with local businesses we are also able to provide a number of pickup locations. For those who are not local or just prefer delivery, we use FedEx to provide overnight delivery options.</p>
          <p>In the Winter of 2017, Macro Meals opened it’s online store to the public. And the rest is history in the making.</p>
