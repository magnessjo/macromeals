                <div>
                  <p>Different meals have different expiration dates due to the type of protein included in the meal.  Vegan meals tend to have a longer shelf life than meats as a general rule of thumb.  Every meal comes packaged with a enjoy by date and we recommend that you enjoy your meal by that date.  We general prepare, package and ship you meal within 48 hours so all meat meals should have a shelf life on 5 - 6 days when it arrives.</p>

              <div>
                <div>
                  <p>We work with local farmers to provide the fresh organic ingredients.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to provide year round produce from Maryland farms so produce from out of state is required and we are at the mercy of distributors.</p>
