              <h1 class="trajan-headline">Shopping</h1>
              <p>Finding the right nutrients at the grocery store can leave you scratching your head.  Companies use deceptive packaging to make their products enticing. Products are allowed a variance of 20% in their nutrition facts which leads you to wonder what you are really buying.  Products are processed with preservatives to prolong their shelf life and enhance their visual appearance by adding chemicals, fats, and sugars.</p>
              <p>Our lives are not setup to help you maintain a well balanced diet.  Quick and inexpensive meal choices often calorie dense and nutrient poor.  </p>
              <p>Our meals are prepared with fresh whole foods.  We pledge to partner with local farmers as often as possible to provide the freshest local ingredients. </p>

              <p>Cooking is fun but it is also time consuming.  No one can afford the time to prepare three balanced meals at day from scratch.  An active life requires meals on the go which leads many people to food with little nutrient value.</p>
              <p>Unlike other food prep companies; our meals are prepared from scratch.  Ingredient are reviewed for freshness and meals are prepared based on macronutrients to give your body what it needs.</p>
