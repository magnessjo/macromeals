              <h1 class="trajan-headline">Shopping</h1>
              <p>Shopping is a hassle. The grocery store can be a time consuming over crowded nightmare. It is often difficult to determine the nutrients that your body needs and how that translates into what you are putting in your cart. </p>
              <p>The food industry uses misleading labeling to lure you into buying their products. They use terms like “low fat”, “all natural”, or “superfood” to make you think that you are making healthy choices. Often times these quick and inexpensive food options are processed with preservatives and added sugar which make them calorie dense and nutrient poor.</p>
              <p>Our meals are prepared with fresh whole foods, that are nutrient rich.  We also pledge to partner with local farmers as often as possible to provide the freshest local ingredients. </p>

              <p>Cooking is fun but it is also time consuming.  No one can afford the time to prepare three balanced meals at day from scratch.  An active life requires meals on the go which leads many people to food with little nutrient value.</p>
              <p>Unlike other food prep companies; our meals are prepared from scratch.  Ingredient are reviewed for freshness and meals are prepared based on macronutrients to give your body what it needs.</p>
